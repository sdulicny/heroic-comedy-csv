          <h1>What is Comedy Against Authority?</h1>

          <p>Comedy has long been used as an escape during times of social hardship and political unrest. However, comedy has also been a tool in the fight against authoritarianism (or anti-democratic systems), and against the oppression of minoritized groups and individuals. This digital archive features social media content that uses comedy to fight against societal and political authority, shedding light on the importance of comedy as an anti-authoritarian tool.</p>

          <h3>North Atlantic Fellas Organization</h1>
            
            <p2>The North Atlantic Fellas Organization (NAFO) is a grassroots community that fights propaganda at its source, using humour to “shitpost” and “ratio” pro-Russian and anti-Ukraine social media users, particularly Vladimir Putin’s online spokespeople. NAFO also raises funds to support the Ukrainian military in the fight against Russia's invasion. NAFO membership is $5, which covers the cost of the member’s “Fella”: a photoshopped avatar of a Shiba Inu customized to the user’s specifications (i.e., the member can personalize their Fella with a particular theme, clothing, background, and accessories).</p>
            
            <h3>Rechts Gegen Rechts [Right Against Right]</h1>
            
            <p2>The Rechts Gegen Rechts movement resists far-right groups in Germany by remaking their activities into fundraisers for anti-extremist charities. They began by converting neo-Nazi marches into involuntary walkathons, decorating the environment to look like a race and raising donations based on how far each participant walks. More recently, they have started monitoring speech on social media and purchases of neo-Nazi dog whistles, both of which similarly result in donations. They support charities like EXIT Deutschland, which helps people escape extremist groups. Rechts Gegen Rechts’ use of pranks to undermine the neo-Nazi agenda shows the value of comedy as a tool against authoritarian regimes.</p>
